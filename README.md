# LingQ GPT

A python program to generate mini stories for LingQ using the OpenAI API. It currently also supports generating stories from word lists and from most important LingQs.

This tool has helped me somewhat for language learning, however it did not give me the results I was hoping for so be sure to not overly rely on this tool in case you decide you want to use it.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/kaajjaak/LingQPT.git`

2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    
3. Configure the settings: rename the .env.template file to .env and fill in the required API keys, you can get your LingQ API key [here](https://www.lingq.com/accounts/apikey/)

## Deployment

Configure and run the main.py file, you will need to make some additional changes to set the correct language and collection, feel free to make an issue if you don't know how to do so!

The project currently does not have a user interace as I do not believe this program adds much value if any to language learning. I will consider adding more updates in the future, however I will most likely build a new program from scratch in the future!
