# Outlook Generator

Outlook Generator is an automation tool that creates Outlook accounts and stores the email addresses and passwords of the generated accounts. This project leverages Selenium for web automation, the Nopecha extension to solve CAPTCHAs, and WireGuard to bypass IP limitations.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/kaajjaak/LingQPT.git`

2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    
3. Configure the settings: rename the .env.template file to .env and fill in the required API keys, you can get LingQ key [here](https://www.lingq.com/accounts/apikey/)

## Deployment

Configure and run the main.py file, you will need to make some additional changes to set the correct language and collection, feel free to make an issue if you don't know how to do so!

The project currently does not have a user interace as I do not believe this program adds much value if any to language learning. I will consider adding more updates in the future, however I will most likely build a new program from scratch in the future!
